## 🧠 About Me

I'm an AI Engineer and Data Scientist with a background in **numerical physics** (PhD).  
I specialize in building intelligent systems using **Computer Vision**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.  
I have hands-on experience deploying models with **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **CI/CD**, and **AWS Cloud**, and exposing them through scalable **APIs** using **FastAPI**.  
Currently, I'm diving deep into **Agentic AI** to build more autonomous and reasoning-capable systems.  
I enjoy bridging the gap between research and real-world impact.
